# BayesianInference


The Bayesian inference process:

1. Specify a prior pobability distribution that reflects our knowledge about the problem.

2. Collect Data.

3. Calculate the Likelihood: how well the observed data aligns with each possible hypothesis or model. 

4. Apply Bayes’ Theorem: Bayes’ theorem is used to update the prior probabilities into posterior probabilities, taking into account the data and the likelihood. 


5. Make Informed Decisions: The posterior probabilities provide us with updated beliefs about the hypotheses, models, or parameters. We can use these posterior probabilities to make decisions, make predictions, or perform further analysis.
