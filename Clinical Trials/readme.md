Main Question Answered:

How well can the model predict the treatment success rate for new TB cases using dimensionality reduction and top contributing features?

Answer:
The model predicts the treatment success rate for new TB cases with high accuracy and robustness. By applying PCA to reduce dimensionality and focusing on the top contributing features, the model explains, on average, 86.75% of the variance in the target variable across different cross-validation folds, with a consistent performance indicated by a low standard deviation of 0.0225. This demonstrates that the model is both accurate and reliable for predicting the treatment success rate, making it a valuable tool for analyzing and predicting outcomes in TB treatment programs.

Insights:

- Analyzing the top contributing features provides insights into which factors most significantly influence the treatment success rate, helping to inform targeted interventions or further research.
Model Refinement:

- The current model performance can be improved further through hyperparameter tuning and exploring other regression models.

Practical Application:

The high and consistent performance of the model suggests it can be reliably used in practical settings to predict treatment success rates, aiding healthcare providers and policymakers in making informed decisions. By achieving high predictive performance and robustness, the model effectively addresses the main question and provides a solid foundation for further applications and improvements in predicting TB treatment success rates.

- Achievements of the Model:

The model achieved a high R² score on cross-validation, indicating that it explains a significant portion of the variance in the target variable. Mean Cross-validated R² Score: 0.8675, meaning the model, on average, explains 86.75% of the variance in the treatment success rate for new TB cases.

The low standard deviation of the cross-validated R² scores (0.0225) indicates that the model's performance is consistent across different folds, suggesting good generalizability.
Cross-validated R² Scores: [0.9034, 0.8751, 0.8354, 0.8690, 0.8548]
Effective Dimensionality Reduction:

The model retained essential information while reducing complexity, leading to improved performance.
Number of Components Retained: 19, capturing around 95% of the variance.
Identified Key Features: The analysis identified key features that significantly contribute to the variance in the target variable, providing valuable insights for further investigations or decision-making.
